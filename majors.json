In this major, students engage with the ideas and processes involved in making interventions within built and natural environments. Practical application is supported by consideration of relevant theoretical and ethical aspects of architecture. Units in technology, science, history, theory and communication provide core knowledge of the architecture discipline. In these, students learn how to think and communicate through analytical, critical and representational modes. Running in parallel are the design studio units which offer an immersive and integrative experience. In these units, project-based learning develops students' propositional capacities in relation to a range of contextual concerns: theoretical, environmental, technical, material and spatial. Students learn how to conceptualise and design single buildings, urban configurations and landscapes in response to existing and emerging economic and social needs and desires. Manual and digital technologies and production methods are used to generate drawings, models and prototypes. ",

The Landscape Architecture major shares a number of units with the Architecture major. As such, cross-disciplinary content, collaboration and learning are key features of these majors. Other points of distinction include an emphasis on discovery through drawing; grounding in cultural landscapes and integration of culturally diverse content; engagement with contexts that are local, regional and international; and an embedding across learning areas of a deep appreciation for sustainability. By studying this major you will develop essential skills in critical thinking, providing you with a strong understanding in the practical, as well as the theoretical, art of landscape design.

It strives to discover how the Earth system has evolved during the past 4.4 billion years including the origin of continents, oceans, atmosphere and life itself. Geology students learn how to apply knowledge of Earth processes, and the time scales over which these processes operate, to discovering the origin and distribution of important resources such as groundwater, petroleum and minerals, and understanding climate and other environmental changes. As most of Australia's mineral and petroleum resources are in Western Australia, UWA is the ideal place to study Geology. The Geology major is underpinned by the development of fieldwork skills and geological mapping and includes three 7-day field trips to areas in Western Australia (there will be a cost of up to \\$1200 per student, to cover the cost of food and accommodation for ~21 nights).",

The study of these organisms and the role they play in health, disease and the environment is known as microbiology, and immunology is the study of how the body defends itself against such organisms. This major covers a range of fields, from the more applied disciplines such as medical, public health, industrial, and food microbiology, to basic fields of immunology, microbial ecology, physiology and genetics of microbes. Your studies will teach you how microbiology can be applied in areas as diverse as medicine, brewing, food spoilage, control of environmental pollution and space science. You will receive a thorough grounding in the scientific basis of microbiology and its applications in the real world. Graduates in Microbiology and Immunology will be eligible for membership in the Australian Society of Microbiology (ASM)\u2014the national scientific and employment body of the profession.",

The extended major allows you to study animals with a special emphasis on understanding their relative conservation status and options for recovering viable populations of threatened species. Focusing on unique Australian fauna, you will learn about the processes leading to the exceptional biodiversity that exists today, the threats facing this biodiversity and the management strategies and policies that can be used to limit, and in some cases reverse, the impact of these threats. There will be opportunities to study animals living in a diverse range of habitats in Western Australia, from the desert to forests and tropical reefs, and to carry out your studies in both the classroom and in the field. Through studying zoology, ecology, genetics, conservation biology, spatial planning and policy from leading academics and industry partners, you'll gain the expertise and skills to seek employment opportunities in environmental consulting, wildlife conservation programs and fauna management. This extended major also prepares you for entry into Honours in Conservation Biology, honours in Zoology and the Master of Biological Science.",

This major will provide you with a sound knowledge and understanding of animal structure and function and the evolutionary processes that have engendered animal diversity. Zoologists also study physiology, reproduction, behaviour, community ecology and molecular genetics. Zoology underpins society's interest in conservation and marine science including major contributions to current research in fisheries and ecosystem management. It is envisaged that there will be up to two overnight field trips (cost of food and accommodation of up to \\$200 for around four nights to be borne by the student).",

The SCTS major innovatively integrates the skills and knowledge relevant to both science and humanities education.  As the only program of its kind in WA, the SCTS major will appeal to students and employers alike who value this integration.  In the SCTS major, students receive a broad grounding in historical, philosophical, and social dimensions to science and technology with a focused thread on biological sciences and technologies running through all core units in the major. Drawing on units from four schools at UWA, the SCTS major integrates science, technology, and the humanities.  Students will gain substantive knowledge of SCTS as an established interdisciplinary area of study.  They will also develop the corresponding analytic, technical, and integrative skills much in demand by employers seeking students with flexible suites of learning skills.",

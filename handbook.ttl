The Economics major prepares you for work in financial institutions, government, international agencies and the private sector as a forecaster, analyst or consultant. The major includes core subjects in both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics provides the framework for analysing issues in taxation, trade and the competitive structure of markets, while macroeconomics focuses on the forces that influence long-term economic growth, inflation, unemployment and the balance of payments. Students also develop the capacity to understand the fundamental workings of the economy and markets, and implications of economic policy. The Economics major can be combined with a major in Finance if you are interested in pursuing a career as a financial economist." ;

It does so in order to address what are the greatest challenges facing contemporary human societies: how to undertake wholesale energy transitions, and to develop sustainable food systems, in a context of climate emergency. Drawing on literature from across environmental and economic anthropology, it will examine how these challenges might be met, through re-imagining our ‘cultures of energy', by developing new modes of production, and by re-organising relations with our ‘discards' (i.e. rubbish) and, ultimately, by rethinking the very form of human connections with other parts of the living world (land, crops, fish, animals, bacteria and viruses). Climate change will force human societies to adapt, in ways that will generate new kinds of human sociality, and will require new modes of multi-species relations.

This unit considers how this data is produced. In a workshop setting, students read and analyse productions of the ethnographic imagination. By immersing themselves in the first-hand experiences of anthropologists, criminologists and social scientists and their fieldwork settings, students familiarise themselves with the process of 'doing' ethnography. The unit may address the following issues: (1) the connection of explanatory theories to methods of research; (2) methods of studying and interpreting everyday life—participant observation (everyday life as field research), questioning, recording, note-taking; (3) eliciting and interpreting accounts of social life—semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, genealogies, family histories, participatory social research; (4) observing and interpreting categories and symbols; (5) using information technology resources to source methods and explanations; (6) engaging with innovative and interdisciplinary research methodologies and issues; and (7) how to use ethnography to engage in inter-cultural analysis. The unit is focused upon jobs-ready skills. By the end, students will have developed the knowledge and experience necessary to immediately begin using ethnography, whether in the heritage sector, or in criminal justice, or in social policy and analysis.

As such, it is thought of as an extension and further development of ARCT2030 Materials and Small Constructions. Through a similarly analytical methodology it introduces students to construction techniques of greater complexity, with an emphasis on architecture as an integrated manifestation of structure, body, skin and building services. 
Topics include architectural and structural analysis, materials and sections; fire services and safety; hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical systems, and the types and applicability of constructional systems to different architectural expressions. 
The unit generates an understanding of the integration of structures and services in medium- to large-scale buildings. The vehicle for this is the combined effect of weekly lectures and workshops. Lectures investigate and critically analyse a number of selected buildings highlighting architectural, structural and technical aspects that pertain to different materials and construction techniques. They also illustrate specialist drawings produced by consultants, including structures and services. In the workshops students conduct an analysis of selected buildings, to identify the relationships between architecture, space, structure and technology. Such analysis evolves weekly through progressive reviews with a tutor at each workshop and it culminates in two submissions during the semester.""" ;

    rel:Description """A central aim of this unit is to investigate how culture serves the political objectives of the state and how resistance to state power is also often derived from culture. Close interaction between the state and sociocultural life has been a fundamental feature of countries in the Asian region since the end of the colonial era and has been seen as crucial to nation building. In recent years most Asian nations have experienced extraordinarily rapid economic change, at times resulting in acute social tensions including huge disparities in income, aggravated rural–urban dichotomies, ethnic conflict, regional separatism, gender inequalities, environmental devastation, and the dislocation and relocation of huge numbers of people. 
In the unit students explore the meanings of key concepts such as culture, political culture, society and the state. They explore the role culture plays in holding the societies of Asia together despite the tensions of modernisation and globalisation, and the extent to which culture is/can be guided (or controlled) by the state for this purpose. The unit also examines how state-sponsored cultural forms are resisted and subverted by various groups within society. Special attention is given to Southeast Asia, China and Japan and students are encouraged to explore specific issue(s) within the context of these regions. The unit allows students to explore a range of areas where state power in Asia and the idea of national cohesion via cultural manipulation impact directly on the diverse ethnic populations that make up society in much of Asia. Students are expected to problematise state cultural agendas and demonstrate an understanding of the way in which society resists, even in the face of the staunchest efforts of the state, to control culture. 
The academic objectives of the unit are to develop an understanding of the complexities of sociocultural, political, economic transformations and interactions in postcolonial Asia through the lenses of culture/power/resistance. A further academic objective is to have students more fully understand and utilise various social and political theories and ideas related to the study of contemporary society in Asia.""" ;

Specifically, it seeks to highlight the relevance of popular culture as a lens through which to analyse social, cultural, political and economic change. Through the study of popular culture, students explore how globalisation, inter- and intra-regional integration, cultural politics, consumerism, gender and sexual identities are articulated across societies in East and Southeast Asia. The unit also considers globalisation and global discontinuities in the context of the production, circulation and consumption of popular culture both from the West to Asia, and increasingly from Asia to the rest of the world. The unit examines these issues with reference to various spaces and practices of popular culture, such as film, television and popular music; fan cultures and social media; fashion and beauty cultures; postcolonialism and nationalism; and popular protest cultures.

How do they work, how do they endure, how are they legitimated, and why do some ultimately collapse?  With a focus on East and Southeast Asia, this unit explores not only varieties of authoritarianism but also the global and local factors which lead to democracy in some countries and authoritarianism or even dictatorship in others. Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, it investigates political forms of rule, ideologies, leaders and leadership, state-society relations, and resistance movements. Students will learn to analyze similarities and differences between various regimes, explain the rise and fall of autocratic governments, and connect wider global trends to local manifestations in Asia, gaining an understanding of the persistence of authoritarianism in our own times.

More than 80% of electronic data in modern societies are generated and stored in textual format. How to process unstructured text to extract useful insights and support actionable decision making and discover the hidden treasure of collective intelligence is of enormous value. In this unit, we start with traditional text processing techniques using Regular Expressions and discuss the needs of text processing and normalisation. We then introduce fundamental pipelines of natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech tagging and various ways of sentence parsing, with the aim of introducing traditional text feature collection techniques for higher-level tasks such as sentiment or document classification. Building on the understanding of the pros and cons of feature-based NLP pipeline approaches, the unit moves onto the modern approach of deep learning for NLP, focusing on word vector representation, neural language models, and recurrent neural networks for NLP.

    rel:Description """This unit provides an introduction to Roman history from 44 BC to AD 68, a period which began with the assassination of Julius Caesar and finished with the death of the Emperor Nero. This was a period of profound cultural and political change at Rome and in the wider Mediterranean world, which coincided with the drift towards the establishment of a monarchical system of government at Rome, led by a 'princeps', or 'first citizen'. Moreover, with the completion of Rome's conquest of the Mediterranean, the inhabitants of once independent kingdoms and communities had now to adapt to life under Roman hegemony.  
In addition to charting the major political and administrative developments of the time, the unit also explores the interactions between Romans and the subject peoples of the Empire. The unit aims not only to impart knowledge about this seminal period in world history but also to interpret and explain key features of it.  
The unit offers a carefully structured program of lectures, identifying and tracing the development of the major political, social and cultural aspects of the ancient Julio-Claudian period, and a complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments that examine some of these aspects in depth. Tutorial participation is a vital part of the learning process and in the development of reasoning and analytical skills. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material and a written in-class assignment and tutorial discussion of this assignment deals specifically with this crucial aspect of ancient historical study. The unit aims to encourage students to develop critical abilities in the process of exploring and evaluating particular events and personalities throughout this period.

It engages further with the major cultural issues raised by Alexander's reign, notably the emergence of ruler-worship. Sources are studied in translation, and historiographical issues are tackled in depth.

    rel:Description """This unit studies the period 146 BC to 44 BC: from the destruction of Corinth and Carthage down to the assassination of Julius Caesar. The unit is concerned with the final generations of the Roman Republic, during which the four centuries of political and social stability gradually evaporated in political murder, civil war, the collapse of moderation and consensus and the transformation of society, all happening against a backcloth of dramatic conquests and imperial expansion that took Roman armies as far as Britain and Iraq. The period saw the transformation of the institutions of the state and the emergence of powerful military men who dominated the Roman political scene. But it was a period which also witnessed the first real flourishing of Latin literature. 
The unit aims to impart knowledge about one of the most significant periods in ancient Mediterranean history, the transition of Rome from a republic to an empire. Students are introduced to both the political and social history of the period and develop an appreciation of the importance of the relationship between the social and political mechanisms in the ancient Roman world. Students are encouraged to make independent analysis and criticism of such fundamental aspects as political alliances, personal alliances, the stratification of society, the division of wealth, etc. The unit emphasises the importance of the ancient written evidence, such as the personal correspondence and forensic speeches of M. Tullius Cicero, the personal accounts of the Gallic and Civil wars by C. Julius Caesar, and the historical monographs of Sallust, and the later accounts of Plutarch, Appian and Cassius Dio.

    rel:Description """Roman Britain is probably the most extensively and intensively studied of all the Roman provinces. The explanation lies in the early and sustained interest of antiquarians and scholars in the 'Trace of Rome' in the British landscape, and in the pioneering role and high standards of scholarship among the large numbers of Romano-British archaeologists. The result can be seen in the widespread teaching of Roman Britain as a course not just in the United Kingdom but throughout the English-speaking world. This unit investigates the history and material culture of Britain from Caesar's expeditions in the first century BC through to the end of Roman Britain in the early fifth century AD. The unit covers military history and developments, town and country, Romanisation and explanations for the end of Roman Britain.
The objectives of the unit include providing an insight into a significant phase in the history of a single Roman province. Equally important is the expectation that students discover graphically how a variety of types of evidence from archaeology, through art and numismatics to texts and documents can be integrated to produce a rounded study of a region during a broad period of Roman history.

From the first to the seventh century, there were profound transformations in thinking about God or the Gods in philosophical discourses; the relationship between men and gods; the role of ritual and religion in everyday life, as well as in ethics, history, and their sense of community. This unit examines the evidence for these changes in the literature and material culture from the Mediterranean world, from the religious revival of Augustus, through the ‘age of anxiety' of the second and third centuries, to the triumph of Christianity, and finally to the rise of Islam. Topics that will be covered over the course of this unit will include: the establishment of the Roman imperial cult, the relationship between ancient philosophy and religion, Judaism before and after the destruction of the Temple, religious syncretism in the provinces, ‘eastern' cults at Rome, the beginnings and transformation of early Christianity, and the rise of Islam in the 7th century." ;

    rel:Description "The campaigns of Alexander the Great saw a profound acceleration of the diffusion of Greek culture across a vast swathe of territory, and prompted the emergence, from Egypt to India, of new, hybrid cultures. These new cultures were located within innovative political entities, the Hellenistic kingdoms, and shaped by highly successful dynasties such as the Seleucids and Ptolemies. Mirroring the evolution of these kingdoms in the east was the rise of Rome in the west. This unit explores this dynamic Hellenistic period (323-31 BCE) and the cultural artefacts — from art and architecture to literature — that it produced; it explores also the fluid, and often violent, interactions between these divergent power-blocks, and does so through engagement with the complex and often fragmentary ancient evidence from the period itself." ;

What did ancient writers think about heterosexual and homosexual relationships? How did ancient doctors conceptualise the human body? Were ancient Christian attitudes towards sex different from those of non-Christians of the same period? This unit addresses these questions, as well as others, by introducing students to ancient attitudes towards sex, gender, and conceptions of the human body from Classical Greece through to the advent of Late Antiquity. 
In the first part of the unit, students will investigate ancient sexualities and attitudes towards sex through a close reading of poetry (such as poems by Sappho, Catullus, Ovid), and by interpreting the material culture from the ancient world (erotic art, graffiti). In the second part of the unit, students will consider constructions of gender during the early centuries CE, using the ancient Greek novels as a starting point. Students will investigate not only how the ethical vocabulary of Greece and Rome was heavily gendered, but also how it evolved over time. In the final component, students will investigate how conceptions of the human body changed from Classical to Late antiquity, by examining art, medical texts, and also the writings of Christian theologians. 
Ultimately, this unit challenges students to think more deeply about the differences and similarities between ancient and modern approaches gender, sexuality, and the body, and the utility of employing contemporary theoretical frameworks for interpreting the ancient evidence.""" ;

    rel:Description "This unit offers a close examination of Jane Austen's major novels and analyses the profound influence she has had on contemporary culture. We try to account for why television and cinematic adaptations, and fan-fiction reinventions and mashups of her work continue to appear at a prolific rate. The unit begins by situating Austen as a novelist writing in a particular historical era at the turn of the nineteenth century, with Britain rapidly emerging as one of Europe's foremost maritime and imperial powers. Austen was well aware that the emerging novel form was inspiring lively discussions of its moral and educative effects on a growing, substantially female readership. While her novels have been celebrated down the ages as archetypal romances, the unit draws on recent scholarly debates in order to understand Austen's novels as invested in contributing to social and political conversations of her era. Students consider the ethics of Austen's novels which can be interpreted as promoting sociable virtues and as extolling companionate marriage in a period in which sharply defined gender roles generated incomprehension and misunderstanding between the sexes. Throughout the unit students examine Austen's extraordinary influence on popular culture as a romantic, melancholic and ironic author." ;

    rel:Description "World War I was seen by many young artists of the time as a cultural as well as a political crisis—as the culmination and damnation of Western culture as it was consolidated in the nineteenth century. This disillusionment led to the experimental art practices that became known collectively as the avant-garde, which found their most radical and tumultuous expressions in the period between 1914 and 1930. This unit offers an opportunity to focus on 'High' modernist texts, by placing them in historical context and tracing the ways in which they contest established ideas of the reader, personal identity, sexuality, perception and aesthetics, and explores technology and popular culture. In keeping with modernism's cosmopolitanism the unit looks at texts from England, Europe and the USA, and ranges through literary and filmic genres." ;

Their engagement with the social and cultural changes created by the French Revolution produced innovations in fiction, poetry and prose, and helped form much of what we regard as modern experience and ideas. Topics investigated include Romantic concerns with social outsiders and individual freedom; disenchantment with reason and emphasis on the imagination; the re-evaluation of nature and criticism of urban industrialism; and outspoken concern for social justice. The unit considers Romantic and Gothic preoccupations with questions of gender and class power.

    rel:Description """This unit provides a study of poetry in English spanning the period from Medieval times to the present. Poetry is a rather marginalised art in contemporary Western societies, including Australia, but those involved in it tend to believe in its value passionately. This derives from the belief that poetry is the deepest form of human expression, certainly the most profound form that language ever attains. The unit examines poetry and poetic language both in analysis and in practice, covering technical and philosophical elements of poetry and relating them to shifts in cultural values in the society from which each work emerged. This unit combines the approaches of literary criticism and creative writing, allowing students to choose which approach they take up in assessment. 
As a Level 3 unit, this unit aims to further develop students' skills in creative and/or critical research, textual analysis and oral and written communication through focused engagements with specific texts and theories, and via an emphasis on independent learning through strategies such as targeted research tasks and creative projects.

    rel:Description "From Degas' selfies to Warhol's serials, photography has reshaped artistic practice since the nineteenth century.  This unit investigates how artists have deployed photography as an observational tool and expressive medium since the first creation of the fixed image.  By analysing a diverse range of global photographic practices from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present day, the unit charts how the photograph changed the artistic discourse surrounding mimesis and visual representation.  The history of photography reveals a persistent debate concerning the truth-value of the photographic image, and this unit examines how artists have explored and challenged the idea of the photograph as a form of documentary evidence.  The photograph is much more than a mechanical capture of a moment, and this class considers how artists construct, manipulate, and market photographs as forms of representation.  In the photographic realm, what differentiates an artist from an amateur?  What is the role of artifice in the art photograph?  How has photography responded to and changed the global art market?  Through exposure to a wide range of photographic methods and artists, students learn how art historians critically discuss, contextualise and analyse photographs." ;

Building on Baudelaire's definition of modernity as the transient experience of urban living, the unit explores how the city shaped the European visual imagination after 1850. Conceived as a simulated stroll through late nineteenth-century Paris, the unit explores how civic planning, industry, material consumption, and politics redefined spatial and visual form.  Though the unit is grounded in the art of painting, it also explores how new visual developments, particularly photography, challenged and shaped the definition of modern France.

    rel:Description "In Italian art of the seventeenth century, things are never quite as they seem. Caravaggio's highly naturalistic paintings merge biblical figures with local prostitutes and beggars; the sculptor Bernini turns hard marble into soft flesh and stillness into motion; Borromini's buildings appear to pulsate and envelope their visitors; and heaven and earth converge in vast ceiling paintings of palaces and churches. Besides such illusions, the Baroque revels in drama. Art no longer needs to be aesthetically pleasing - it can be ugly or horrific in its quest to provoke strong emotions. It is a period of innovation, producing the first feminist artist and the first global style. Yet it also is the first period fully aware of the history of art, bringing about changes in collecting and theorising art that reverberate into the nineteenth century. This unit examines Baroque art and architecture in the context of major historical developments, such as the Catholic Counter-Reformation and early colonialism. It also studies contemporary art theory through the prism of its arguable most iconic artist, the Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio." ;

Contemporary art is a Utopian term which aims to include all kinds of art produced around the world since the 1960s, though some art from this period has been more prominent than others. The unit goes on to investigate some of the power relationships at work within the institutional structures of contemporary art production and display, looking at some of the major actors (curators, museums, patrons and others) who have enabled artists to become successful in the late-twentieth century. The unit will give students the ability to recognise and discuss contemporary art, and to address the central contentions that contemporary art presents for art history. It assesses the relativity of the value systems that produce art history, and the relationship of art history's narratives to a period of art production that is defined as post-historical, postmodern and post-gender. It gives students a crucial grounding in the thinking, actors and relationships for art produced in our own time, understandings that graduates seeking employment in the art world today require." ;

It focuses on the disciplinary shift from European modernism to global, multiple modernisms that emerged out of situations of cultural contact and exchange. Today, modernism also describes a mode of art that engages with globalisation, with the big picture issues of economic and cultural convergence and collision. The unit develops the student's ability to recognise debates over the nature of modernism and discern their central contentions.

    rel:Description "Growing out of a fascination with Pulp Fiction and the prolific B films produced during the pre-war period in America, the Film Noir cycle is a unique example of a truly indigenous American cultural form. From the 1940s, Film Noir provided the 'black slate' on which Hollywood inscribed American social paranoia of the unknown. Fascinated by the formal qualities of these films, the young French cineastes and critics centred around the Cahiers du Cinema and formulated a series of critical strategies to reform the nature of conventional cinema. This unit examines a number of selected feature films from the American Film Noir cycle as a foundation on which the various strategies of the early French New Wave can be dissected and studied. Auteur and genre based critical approaches of the cinema are examined through the films of Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut and in relation to the theories of both filmmakers (as well as Andre Bazin, Alexandre Astruc, Christian Metz and others).

The evolution of modern-day museums and art galleries is traced to the early modern 'chamber of wonders' and the establishment of large national institutions, starting with the British Museum in the mid-eighteenth century. Key themes include how gallery displays reinforce the public's perception of canons of art or how they suggest the boundaries between fine art and ethnography? And what particular issues do Australian collections face today? In addition, students receive an introduction to aspect of collection management, from acquisition policies or exhibition design to museum education programs. Students receive the opportunity to label and hang objects in a model room, to critically explore aspects of current museological practice and to carry out research on these. Site visits to museums (including the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Lawrence Wilson Art Gallery or the Berndt Museum of Anthropology) and other local collections constitute a major element of this unit, affording students a ‘look behind the scenes' and the possibility to acquire basic object handling skills." ;

    rel:Description "The introduction of prints on paper around 1400 is often cited as a media revolution comparable only to our own, recent transition into the digital age. Invented in China several centuries earlier, printmaking profoundly changed Western visual culture as low-cost, multiple-image prints permeated everyday life from card playing to personal devotion. Such was the significance of prints in the transmission of artistic and political ideas that they soon required regulation in the form of copyright or censorship. Within the larger context of Europe's emerging colonial and missionary ambitions, prints also communicated between 'centre' and 'periphery', with images of Christian saints being printed as far afield as Mexico and China and visual records of foreign costumes and customs streaming back into Europe. This unit examines the production and reception of prints both as exclusive, high art and as popular, low art. Particular focus is paid to the implications of their status as multiples, their impact on the dissemination of knowledge, and their role as agents in cultural exchange." ;

An upper-class Parisian who became a rebellious Bohemian, Manet revolutionised painting in late nineteenth-century France. Through a close examination of Manet's painting practice and artistic community, the unit examines how Manet challenged political authority and artistic convention. Often considered an important bridge between the concerns of Realism and the emergence of Impressionism in France, Manet's oeuvre engages crucial debates concerning the role of observation and reality in painted representation. Manet cultivated a style that invoked leftist politics, popular culture, art history and Japanese aesthetics, and the unit considers how Manet's work responds to shifts in the political and cultural landscape of Paris.

    rel:Description "Tracking the shifting notion of both the citizen and the 'self', this unit explores the complex history of the nineteenth century through the lens of the portrait. By analysing visual representations and their social reception, the unit employs portraiture as both a fulcrum and foil for understanding the role of the individual in nineteenth century society. How does portraiture respond to political and cultural changes? Who is portrayed and for what audience? What is the role of the 'real' in portraiture of the nineteenth century? Implicit in this analysis is a consideration of the artist-as-individual and the personal and political stakes of self-portraiture. The nineteenth century witnessed a dramatic change in the reception and creation of portraits; by analysing the self as the subject, observer and producer of images, the unit explores how the individual evolved from an Enlightenment ideal to a 'modern subject' over the course of the nineteenth century." ;

    rel:Description """This unit focuses on the art of the Dutch Golden Age and early explorations. What were the effects on art and culture of Dutch explorations at home and abroad? How does the work of artists like Rembrandt and Vermeer reflect globalisation? In the seventeenth century, the world was changing rapidly. Since the end of the fifteenth century, it had been mostly the Spanish and Portuguese who set sail to the Americas, Africa and Asia. But when the Dutch entered the scene at the turn of the seventeenth century, they very soon became the most dominant power in the overseas trade. The establishments of permanent trading posts and settlements in Asia, Africa and America not only brought the Dutch in contact with local cultures, they permanently changed them. At the same time, trade with faraway lands brought unknown wealth to the Netherlands. A new class of wealthy merchants developed a taste for paintings, prints, shells, tulips, porcelain, and exotic objects for their new houses. The question is whether the overseas trade, the import of foreign artefacts and the encounter with 'the other' not only profoundly changed Dutch art but also had a lasting effect on the culture and society of the Dutch Republic. In this unit we discuss the encounters with foreign cultures and the impact of cultural exchange, the view of 'the other' (visual ethnography versus exoticism and its racist undercurrents), and the phenomenon of transculturation and globalisation.
This unit is characterised by a hands-on approach, with numerous on and off-campus visits to public and private collections.""" ;

    rel:Description "In the early fifteenth century, art produced in the Burgundian Netherlands (an area consisting of present-day Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France) was celebrated and exported as far afield as Italy and Spain. The introduction of oil paint had given rise to a revolutionary style of painting, allowing artists like Jan van Eyck to create seemingly hyper-realistic representations that reflected new interests in the depiction of nature and human emotion. This unit charts principal developments of the so-called Northern Renaissance, from its origins in court art of the Burgundian Netherlands around 1400, its dominance over the European market for much of the fifteenth century up until the increasing engagement of sixteenth-century artists like Albrecht Dürer with developments in contemporary Italian art. Students are introduced to the visual language of the period and the ways in which figures like Hieronymus Bosch subverted traditional iconographies. Key themes include the use of art in religious ceremony, the rise of new artistic genres, changes in art patronage and the art market, and the emerging awareness of national styles and their historiographies. While special emphasis is placed on painted works, the unit also considers other art forms such as manuscript illumination, carved wooden altarpieces, tapestries and stained glass." ;

    rel:Description """In the late nineteenth century the nation-states of Europe controlled the destiny of the world. The continent's extraordinary achievements, the unprecedented harnessing of nature through science, technology and industry, the flourishing of the arts and the possession of the power, the will and the ruthlessness to found new Europes across the globe, confirmed to most Europeans that they were at the forefront of human progress, the vanguard of world history. The European trading, monetary and financial system was welding the world into the first globalized farm, factory and market.  At home, as the mass of Europe's people became or struggled for entitlement as citizens, democracy and constitutional government seemed everywhere to be on the horizon. Peace reigned. Fifty years later the continent lay in ruins. Inter-national, civil, class, ethnic and racial war had swept through Europe leaving behind devastation that would have been unthinkable only a generation before. Dictatorship and tyranny marked the politics of the era. Revolutions, genocides and the unparalleled will to annihilate people and property had seemingly overtaken the Old World like a gigantic natural disaster. Yet the tens of millions of dead and the squandering of so much of Europe's extraordinary capital and heritage had been a self-inflicted calamity. From 1945, chastened, weakened and horrified, Europeans began the slow process of rebuilding, but now in a world that had been irrevocably transformed. 
Covering topics such as the First World War, the Russian Revolution, Fascism, the rise of Europe's totalitarian dictatorships, the Spanish Civil War, the Holocaust and the horror and the grandeur of the Second World War, this unit investigates the baleful journey of European history between 1890 and 1945, when the continent went to hell and back.""" ;

This unit asks: how did Human Rights evolve? Are Human Rights the product of a peculiarly European heritage, or is its moral, cultural, and political basis far wider than this? In what ways are Human Rights different from individual rights, legal rights and civil rights? Did human rights serve as a 'civilizing' mask for colonialism, and what has been the relationship between decolonisation and the question of rights? We examine the impact of the American and French Revolutions on the advancement of ideas about human rights, and how other threads such as the law, the Cold War, Apartheid, and the 'War on Terror' have undermined them. We also examine the impacts of slavery, imperialism, war, and genocide, as well as responses to them, and global movements such as civil, indigenous, women's, and minority rights, and the rise of the modern human rights movement.

Students master 'historiography'—the theoretical foundation of the discipline. Such theory can be as exciting as the past itself. Historians have disagreed bitterly about historical practice, to the point where commentators write passionately about 'history wars'. The unit surveys the embattled development of the discipline by examining exemplary historians. It locates these figures in their time and place, while relating them to the great conceptual issues that engage historians today. Among these issues, it studies social and cultural history, discusses feminist, poststructuralist, and postcolonial interventions in the History discipline, and considers postmodern critiques of historical 'truth' itself.

It examines the key developments that shaped Britain from political reform and constitutional union in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries to industrial powerhouse in the nineteenth century. Throughout, special attention is given to the social consequences of economic expansion and how people experienced these. Students critically assess a wide range of primary and secondary sources in order to uncover the creation of Britain as a political entity and to assess how far, and why, she was altered by massive economic and demographic change. They explore the origins of political union between Scotland and England; the extent to which a common British identity emerged in the eighteenth century; developments in leisure, sport and coffee-house culture; sex and the Victorians; masculinity and gender ideals; Victorian values; the British Empire; the struggle for political reform; and the challenge to British industrial supremacy in the late nineteenth century.

This unit critically interrogates the national framework for Australian history, aiming to explore the continent's long-term history in regional and global context, and its culturally diverse identities. Applying a historical focus to the many ways the continent has been understood, we adopt a case study approach, starting with the concept of ‘Deep Time', our geological and biological history, the arrival of humans, Asian polities and trade, cosmopolitan networks and European ‘discovery' from the 17th century onwards, British imperialism, colonisation and cultural exchange, and key themes in the Australian imaginary over the 19th century such as multicultural economies, gender and empire, and citizenship and rights at Federation in 1901.

This subject charts colonised peoples' responses to European and Australasian imperialism from late 18th into the 21st Century, with case studies of Indonesian responses to Dutch colonisation, Aboriginal and Dalit responses to British colonisation in Australia and India, Korean responses to Japanese colonisation, Kinh and Montagnard responses to the Chinese and French colonisation of Vietnam, and Australia's role as an imperial power in the Pacific. How, and where, have colonists' assertions of legal sovereignty affected colonised and Indigenous people? How have Indigenous and colonised people used imperial languages and legal systems, routes and rights discourses for their own ends? And how have Indigenous and colonised people represented and contested imperialism in contemporary film and fiction? Students will gain an understanding of the ways that colonised and Indigenous peoples have variously negotiated, gained knowledge about, and resisted imperial power, engage with contemporary debates about empire, and assess the diversity of violent and peaceful strategies of responding to imperialism." ;

    rel:Description "Sport provides a sense of belonging, gives meaning to people's lives, and helps to define how we see ourselves and others. It has shaped the world we live in - being widely used as a forum for establishing and challenging social, racial and gendered power structures. It's also one of the world's most lucrative businesses - generating billions of dollars in advertising revenue and corporate sponsorship and through cutting-edge marketing. This unit examines the changing relationship between sport, society and commerce in a global context between 1850 and 2020. It looks at how sport contributes to understandings of, and is shaped by, issues such as identity, protest, race, gender, celebrity, ethics, marketing, commerce and the media. Specific case studies include: the origins and development of modern sport in Victorian Britain and its Empire; sport and Australian national identity; gender, sexism and sport; the business of sport; sporting brands and celebrities; drugs and racism in sport; and sport as a vehicle for social protest and change. Students will come away with an understanding of different analytical frameworks used in the history of sport; an understanding of the historical context within which to appreciate the changing nature and evolution of sport; and an understanding of how the history of sport can inform pressing issues in society, business and sports science today. The unit has been designed to give it a broad inter-disciplinary appeal. No prior study of history is required." ;

This unit draws on the tools of historical analysis, bolstered by criminological and sociological theories, to unpack this profound contradiction.  Based on the dictum *nullem crimen sine lege* (there is no crime without law), it introduces students to key events in US history and key concepts in the historical sociology of crime, deviance, and rebellion, via foundational categories of identity and difference: race, class, gender, dis/ability, sexuality, citizenship, Indigeneity, and alienage. Drawing on topics ranging from witchcraft trials to indefinite detention in the War on Terror, from fugitive slaves to unfree Indigenous labor in Spanish missions, from lynch mobs to the death penalty, from police militarization to prisoners' rights movements, and from border policing to mass immigrant deportation, students will assess the ways in which notions of crime and deviance have evolved in historical contexts to produce a massive American carceral state, and the social movements that have emerged to challenge it." ;

    rel:Description "Russia's twentieth century was a history of extremes. At its beginning, Europe's last great aristocratic autocracy was violently overthrown by a series of revolutions, the last of which purported to be the harbinger of the paradise of world communism. A brutal civil war marked the beginning of the planet's first experiment in socialist state power. Lenin's early death witnessed the ascendancy of Stalin and the ruthless imposition of his own revolution from above: collectivisation, breakneck industrialisation and mass terror paved the way for the coming into being of a Soviet Union capable, through the sacrifice of millions of more Soviet lives, of meeting and defeating the exterminatory war unleashed by the Nazis on Russia and the world. Emerging from that conflict as a global superpower, the Soviet Union, expanded to an empire spanning now from Berlin to Japan, locked horns for planetary supremacy with the USA. Communism survived Stalin's death in 1953, and sought to keep pace internally and externally. Matching its rival in nuclear weaponry and in the space-race, as well as in policing its sprawling empire, Russia under Khrushchev and Brezhnev gradually fell behind in the battle for the hearts and minds of its citizens and the world. By the 1980s the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe emphatically symbolised the Soviet Union's redundancy. Under Gorbachev, reform aimed at salvaging the salvageable spiralled out of control and between 1989 and 1991 the Soviet Union first lost its empire and then imploded. The entity emerging from the wreckage of so many dreams and disasters struggled to find its way. Putin's rise to power in the last years of the twentieth century opened up yet another dramatic chapter in this nation's extraordinarily fraught history. Through engagement with and analysis of a broad range of documents, histories, debates and historiography, this unit surveys Russia's awe-inspiring, tragic and brutal twentieth century." ;

Apart from the mathematical interest of groups, they are of great and increasing importance in Chemistry, Geology and Physics, and those aspects that have significance in such disciplines are strongly emphasised. The fundamental notion is that of a group action. Group actions are used to elucidate the structure of a group, culminating in the Sylow theorems, which connect finite groups and number theory. The applications of group actions extend to symmetries of the plane, three-space and higher dimensional spaces, rotation and spin, crystallographic groups and symmetries of regular figures in two and three dimensions. Other algebraic structures such as rings and fields may also be explored." ;

Originally all geometry was Euclidean geometry, but attempts to prove the independence of the parallel postulate from the other axioms of Euclid led to the discovery of many other types of geometry. These new geometries are not just pure mathematical inventions but they played a key role in the development of physics and, in particular, Einstein's theory of general relativity. This unit looks at a selection of some of these geometries and the theory behind them, such as Riemannian geometry and projective geometry.

Students become familiar with some of the major historical and contemporary debates in this field of philosophy such as whether or not the mind is physical in nature. The unit surveys a variety of competing theories such as behaviourism, mind–brain identity theory, functionalism and dualism. The answer to this debate helps determine the issue of whether one can build a machine that has a mind. Of course, this raises questions about what it is to have a mind. Must there be some rudimentary intelligence? If a machine can play chess, does it have a mind? Does a mind (or its owner) have to house the capacity to feel such things as pleasure and pain? Must it be able to think? What is it to have a thought about something such as a unicorn? Can we ever tell if a machine is conscious, and what is consciousness? Must something be conscious for it to have a mind? Consciousness is one of the biggest remaining mysteries in the world today and the unit addresses questions that enable us to think about the issue more clearly." ;

Scientific psychology and modern psychiatry have both been deeply intertwined with philosophical reflection since their inception more than a century ago. Moreover, recent decades have seen an explosion in interdisciplinary research, with philosophers, psychiatrists, and psychologists collaborating in an effort to understand the mind in health and disease. Topics covered in this unit may include, but are not limited to: cognitivism and behaviourism; the status of introspection and first-person reports; the nature of emotions, beliefs, desires, imagination, and other mental states; personal identity and the self; the relationship between different levels of explanation (neural, cognitive, and phenomenological); the place of neuroscience in psychology and psychiatry; the ‘medical model' of psychiatry; the nature and definition of mental disorder; psychiatric nosology (taxonomy of mental disorder); and philosophical issues relating to psychopharmacology and the use of drug treatments in psychiatry" ;

Areas of enquiry vary and may include—What is art? What is the value of art? What do we learn from art? What is beauty? How important is a definition of art and the artists' intentions in understanding or appreciating a work of art? What is an aesthetic experience and how can aesthetic value be determined? Are there objective standards of taste? Can one person's judgement regarding works of art be better than another's? What should the role of an art critic be? Is so-called 'high' art more valuable than 'low' art? Is mass art 'art' and is it morally problematic? What is the relation between aesthetics and ethics? Why do we enjoy watching horror films and why do we emotionally react to works of fiction? What, if anything, is wrong with sentimentality? Special topics include—Is photography an art? Is architecture an art? How does music express emotion? The unit also looks at the aesthetic appreciation of nature.

    rel:Description """This unit is an introduction to the philosophy of language. Language is a fundamental feature of all our lives, and yet in many ways it remains quite mysterious. It focuses on two of the most interesting mysteries about language—what is linguistic meaning, and how do linguistic expressions come to possess it? In considering these questions the unit also considers questions about how meaning depends on context and the relation between the intended meaning of our utterances and their actual meaning. Students also contemplate the importance of the concept of truth in thinking about meaning. 
The unit aims to (1) provide students with the intellectual skills and knowledge to theorise about the nature of linguistic meaning in a deep and systematic way; (2) give students the tools necessary to engage with much contemporary philosophy (philosophy of language was seen as fundamental to analytic philosophy for much of the twentieth century and continues to have profound implications for most sub-disciplines); and (3) build on, and complement, two specific units offered by the School of Social Sciences and the School of Humanities (without these units being prerequisites)—LING3005 Semantics: Meaning in Language and PHIL2002 Logic: How to Defeat Your Foes with Reasoning.""" ;

Thinkers discussed may include Kant, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Gadamer and Derrida. Much continental philosophy can be read as an attempt to find a way between traditional philosophical dichotomies such as subject/object, internal/external, realism/anti-realism. As a result, each of these philosophers has important things to say about truth, meaning, the self, knowledge and our relation to others. Given the profound influence of these philosophers on Western thought, their work is of central importance to all students of the humanities and social sciences." ;

The first part of the unit focuses on classical first-order logic and its metatheory: we discuss the interpretation of first-order logic and how to construct proofs within it. We then show that any such proof yields a valid argument (soundness) and that there is a proof for every valid argument (completeness). The rest of the unit discusses some more advanced topics in logic. These may include non-classical logics (e.g., modal logics, multi-valued logics, fuzzy logics, intuitionist logics, relevance logics, second-order logic), model-theoretic features of first-order logic (e.g., the compactness and Löwenheim-Skolem theorems), as well as an introduction to computability, recursion, and Gödel's incompleteness theorems." ;

    rel:Description """Just about any decision we make is made under conditions of uncertainty.  This goes for common everyday decisions, such as whether to bring an umbrella or whether to cross the street, where we face uncertainty about rain and traffic accidents respectively. But it also goes for big life-changing decisions at the personal level, e.g., choosing a university degree or life partner, and at the policy level, e.g., choosing a policy to address climate change or income inequality. What should we believe in the face of uncertainty? And how can we take uncertainty into account when choosing what to do?
This unit will introduce you to rational choice theory, which aims to answer such questions. The basic ingredients of most views in rational choice theory are probabilities, which are used to represent the decision-maker's beliefs about how likely different possibilities are, and utilities, which represent the decision-maker's preferences. We will spend the majority of this unit discussing and criticizing these central notions.
More specifically, we will look at the interpretation of probability, expected utility theory as the dominant view in decision theory, the distinction between risk and uncertainty, paradoxes in decision theory, Dutch Book arguments, the recently popular epistemic utility theory, and game theory.""" ;

Students explore the context in which these states conduct their foreign relations: historical links between these states, the impact of colonisation and postcolonisation in shaping their identities, and the relationship between them and the changing dynamics of international politics are considered. The unit focuses on questions of state and human security, and explores how major and small states in these regions have responded to international pressures in the post-Cold War world. It explores the nature and limits of growing interdependence between South Asia and the Middle East in political, social, cultural and economic spheres with reference to select case studies. Students are given the opportunity to discuss the impact of the globalising world on the nature and limits of cooperation and competition between these states with reference to two sets of issues: (1) human security issues such as migrant workers, child trafficking, population control, women's rights and food security; and (2) developments in Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan and the Arab Spring.

    rel:Description """This unit explores the various historical, social, political and international dimensions of contemporary China, whose global rise has caught the world's imagination due to its newly acquired economic, military and soft power prowess. The unit is focused on the major issues and policies of the People's Republic of China (PRC), particularly the political economy of its reform and modernization drive, the country's changing political institutions, expanding civil society, and prospects of democratization. The other components of a Greater China will also be examined – thus, political transformation in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and global Chinese diaspora will be studied for their interactions with, and impact on, the mainland China.
Specifically, an introductory lecture will present the analytical frameworks by critiquing the various scholarly approaches to the study of China, and the rest of the unit will then progress through five integrated topical themes, each of which will be based on a number of lectures. Theme 1 provides knowledge of China's pre-1949 political history, discussing the circumstances in which the country became the communist People's Republic of China, the polity as we know today. Theme 2 investigates the PRC politics chronologically, from Mao's radical class struggle and Cultural Revolution to the current regime's populist authoritarianism with more emphasis on sustainable economic growth, nationalist sentiment and diplomatic clout. Theme 3 examines the major political, social, environmental, and ethnic challenges and crises during the reform era, as well as looking for signs of political liberalisation and future democratization.  Theme 4 is focused on China's evolving international relations, looking into the party-state's changing foreign policy, its passionate pursuit of soft power and the mounting challenges to the state's most important bilateral relations. Theme 5 looks at the developments in the “other Chinas”, namely politics of democratization and unification in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the social and political implications of the rapid expansion of the overseas Chinese communities worldwide. The lecture series will conclude with a grand historical and conceptual assessment of the politics in Greater China.""" ;

From nationalist movements in Latin America, Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries to the movements of the 1960s, where people organised in support of civil rights, gay rights, feminism, peace, and the environment, social movements have played a fundamental role in shaping the architecture of political institutions. More recently, new technologies have furthered cross-border organisation and intensified the global context of extra-institutional politics. This unit examines how and why people participate in politics through social movements, and the complex relationship between rulemaking and rulebreaking.

Students are introduced to the wider organisational context and to how findings in social psychology can be applied to the management of interpersonal behaviour in an organisational setting. Topics in this part of the course cover such topics as culture and diversity, as well as group dynamics and team performance. Through a series of cases studies and a problem-based approach, students are exposed to processes involved in planned change, the role of practitioners in equipment and work redesign including diagnosis, analysis of data and information, feedback of information and the collaborative design of interventions, implementation and evaluation." ;

    rel:Description """Spatial data, information collected from spatial locations, demands high-level statistical methodology to explore, investigate and make scientific conclusions. Such data arises in a wide range of applied fields such as aerial image processing, astronomy, ecology, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, forestry, mineral prospecting, spatial economics and transportation. Spatial dtatistics, the statistical basis for spatial data science, encompasses statistical analysis of three different types of spatial data: geostatistical data, lattice data and point pattern data. Modeling of these different types of data requires different probabilistic and statistical tools. 
This unit begins with a basic introduction to the three types of spatial data and develops some of the statistical tools required to describe and model such data. Then it moves on to in-depth study of a number of topics from the list: spatial stochastic processes, one and higher dimensional point processes, random fields, spatial covariance, variograms, stationarity and non-stationarity, kriging and spatial interpolation, first- and second-order intensity functions, summary functions, spatial models and estimation theory, simulation, spatial regression, spatio-temporal modeling, Bayesian methods in spatial statistics, and analysis of events on linear networks. 
The unit will cover real world examples from many different fields. For statistical analysis and simulation the freeware package R will be used.""" ;

While statistical theory can be helpful in analysing such data, its direct application may be limited by practical problems. For example, some of the data may be missing, some observations may be inconsistent with the rest of the data, the standard assumptions (e.g. normality) may fail, and the standard methods may not answer the important questions. The best way to learn how to deal with these practical problems is to gain experience in analysing real data. This unit provides that experience through case studies and projects. The emphasis is on applying statistical methods to interesting practical problems rather than on the theory behind the methods. 
The unit covers applications of a number of widely used statistical techniques selected from generalised linear models, nonlinear regression models, advanced regression topics, survival analysis, non-parametric statistics, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis.

The unit will also examine how culturally specific social structures, such as generation, kinship and perceived social status, affect patterns of interpersonal communication and relations. Students evaluate how the combination of indigenous philosophical traditions, the legacy of Japanese colonialism, the presence of US military forces on the peninsula, the civil war and the influx of competing Cold War ideologies have shaped contemporary South and North Korean societies.

As part of the field component, students undertake field work in collaboration with officers from the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions to analyse the conservation status, threats and biology/ecology of a selected threatened species. The integrated field-based practical and lecture program in the unit provides an overview of various considerations needed for the design of recovery plans and also critically examines the various factors involved in the conservation of threatened species. 
Topics covered include assessing the conservation status of species, understanding and managing threatening processes such as habitat loss and fragmentation, fire and dieback, genetic considerations (such as in-breeding) associated with small population sizes, genetic drift and hybridisation, spread of disease, reintroduction, translocation and captive breeding, and conservation of threatened species using protected areas.

Narrative Medicine (Charon, 2000) refers to clinical practice infused with narrative competence – the capacity to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by stories of illness. It allows the clinician to enter the narrative world of the patient– through the stories they tell, to dwell and comprehend what is at stake there. This can be achieved through drawing on established literature or writing about oneself and one's patients in order to access deeper meaning and understanding of clinical practice that is otherwise unobtainable. This unit introduces the concepts of narrative medicine including attentive listening, narrative writing, close reading skills, literary and philosophical analysis and reflective reasoning and how to translate this learning to education and clinical settings." ;

    rel:Description "Relational databases are the backbones of modern businesses in processing transactions and storing customer data. Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views. Students study the use of data warehouses through a study of the OLAP technology including the multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP) architectures, OLAP operations and structured query language (SQL) support for OLAP." ;

It combines concepts from 'image processing' (in the spatial and frequency domains) and 'pattern recognition'. Computer vision has a wide number of potential applications, including satellite imaging, control and measurement, industrial inspection, surveillance (e.g. face recognition) and medical applications. This unit covers topics such as binary image analysis, greyscale image manipulation, linear and nonlinear filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, image segmentation and recognition. It also covers camera calibration and projective geometry and how three-dimensional information can be reconstructed from single images, stereo pairs of images and motion sequences. In the future, it is anticipated that computer vision systems will become prevailing, and that vision technology will be more applied across a broad range of business and consumer products. This will result in a strong industry demand for computer vision engineers—for people who understand vision technology and know how to apply it in real-world problems." ;

Moreover, what things can we learn about Greek and Roman culture from the literary and physical remains of these two ancient civilisations? 
‘Glory and Grandeur' provides an introduction to the histories of Ancient Greece and Rome.  It aims to impart knowledge about these ancient civilisations, looking at Greek and Roman politics, warfare, society and culture. It offers a structured program of lectures, which provide a narrative of Greek and Roman history, while also identifying and tracing the development of such major social and political aspects of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations. A complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments provide students with the opportunity to examine some of these topics in depth. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material, and how this material may be used to reconstruct the histories of Greece and Rome.

Businesses vary greatly, from the model firm leading in sustainable business practices to the heavy polluter that seems to go only for the quick buck. How can you explain such diversity? Is it just because some are 'good guys' and others 'bad guys', or is there more to it? This unit addresses these questions and asks: (1) Under what conditions will a business want to improve its management of the environment? (2) How can government and society effectively encourage businesses to want to do better? (3) What aspects of business managers' attitudes and behaviour do we need to understand to better know how they can improve their management of the environment?
This unit is organized into weekly topics that roughly correspond to the chapters of a core textbook, and each week contains three sessions. Topics include environmental externalities, stakeholder analysis, environmental accounting and reporting, environmental management systems and life-cycle-assessment, environmental investments, risk management and insurance, as well as eco-labelling and eco-certification. Each week, session 1 focuses on key concepts and an understanding of the issues based around key chapter readings. Session 2 is a lab session using Internet resources, where students search in small groups for information on a specific industry of their choice. This session also introduces them to some key online databases where they learn how to search for information quickly and efficiently. Session 3 focuses on behavioural aspects of business decision making in relation to environmental (mis)management. In this session, students are introduced to behavioural economics as well as to economic experiments, which are core tools in the study of economic behaviour.

The unit therefore considers facets of these transformations which are central to understanding contemporary employment relations. These include the rise of global corporations; technological and communications change; the reorganisation of work and employment; internal and external labour market change; and the emergence of global production networks and the changing character of local and international trade unionism in response to these structural shifts. The unit considers the relationship between globalisation and these transformations by considering three core issues. First, it identifies and analyses structures of globalisation by discussing organisations, processes, and ideas associated with globalisation and their influence on labour markets, workplaces and society. Second, it considers the experience of work in an era of globalisation by developing a grounded understanding of how globalisation has reshaped work and worker identity.

Skills that students will learn in this course include: foundational skills including programming concepts and an introduction to HTTP, automating the conversion of spatial data formats and working with cloud-native and big spatial data formats, assembling time-series datasets for analysis; accessing data and services using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); practical experience using drones to collect multispectral spatial data; big data wrangling, analysis, and visualization techniques; web-mapping; and, applying big spatial datasets to answer complex problems. 
The unit is designed in two parts. Part 1 is an initial program of 8 weeks, which is focused on developing advanced GIS and big-data programming and handling skills, using data from a range of disciplines. This course uses a student-led inquiry style of teaching, where background materials are presented via on-line learning modules and vignettes, and then supported through face-to-face laboratories.

While naive views of language portray it as a tool used to communicate information, in reality, language defines and shapes communication as much as it serves it. As a result, language greatly contributes to shaping human groups and their organisation. Language indexes group identity, serves to structure society, feeds or resolves conflicts, and more.
This unit will tackle these questions from various disciplinary angles. These include anthropological linguistics, which tells us which aspects of language influence human social life and how; sociolinguistics, which analyses how variation can reflect and enact social groupings; as well as languages in contact between groups and the role of bilingualism -- the use of more than one language in society.""" ;

The focus is on further development of technical and performance skills, preparing students for the higher level of technical development required for other units with the Creative Music Technology sequence of units, and culminates in a performance of repertoire appropriate to this foundational level of tertiary performance study.
This practical unit continues the development of musicianship and technical skills to underpin the input of music to electronic hardware and software via traditional (piano) keyboard.  Keyboard proficiency within a contemporary music idiom and improvisation skills are further developed.  Because each student will commence at a different level of proficiency, a personalised creative contract will form the basis of both instruction and examination of this keyboard component.
The unit also allows students to further develop skills in elements of technical performance skills such as the assembly of various elements of technology for music performance (e.g. microphones, amplifiers, speakers, other electronic components, hardware, software).

This unit is about how we can have knowledge, how we can have justified beliefs about the world. The unit combines the investigation of theoretical questions and problems in epistemology (the theory of knowledge) and the application of these theories to real problems about what we should believe and why.
Not everything that a person believes to be true is something that they know to be true. Under what conditions does a person's belief count as being justified? Is her possessing evidence sufficient to justify the belief? Does anyone have that much evidence about anything? Does the justification of beliefs require that there exist certain 'foundational' beliefs, that is, beliefs where its own justification does not depend upon the agent's other beliefs? If so, what sort of beliefs can be foundational in this sense? Are there 'truths of reason' that are independent of observation that are foundational? What is the status of testimony? Why should someone telling us something justify us in believing it? How can studying epistemology help us sort out the global warming debate?

The unit builds on an understanding of general physiological function and mechanisms developed in the Level 2 Physiology units. Key concepts include the sensory input into different body systems, the application of control theory to body system control, and their response to internal and external factors. Research and communication skills are embedded. The unit focuses on oral presentation skills in science including the use of visual aids, seminar preparation and public speaking, and on teamwork skills, the latter developed through laboratory classes and a student-centred oral presentation conference." ;

The unit first looks briefly at theories of environmental politics, using concepts from international relations, global governance and policy studies, to ask how should we think about the planet and its politics. It then looks at key actors, including states, intergovernmental organisations, transnational corporations and social movements, and how these actors clash to produce political and environmental outcomes. The unit concludes by looking at several case studies of how environmental issues arise, how different actors inform governance and wield authority, what policy solutions might look like, and how political interests prevent them from being implemented. Case studies include the militarization of the Himalayan watershed, intergovernmental climate change agreements, resource extraction in Southern Africa, the governance of the Arctic and Antarctic, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, and the global coal industry's struggle for survival.

It examines the physical environment in which animals live, and the fundamental importance of physiological processes in integrating animal systems with respect to especially energy, thermal and water balance. There is a strong comparative approach for both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. These essential physiological processes are studied using homeostasis as an organising principle, and the actions of the nervous system and hormones in controlling and modulating them. There is a strong emphasis on sensory adaptations and how sensory information is used by animals to safely navigate their environments. A rigorous comparative phylogenetic methods perspective is provided to the interpretation of physiological adaptation. The mechanosensory research project is a mini-research project that introduces students to important skills such as experimental design, literature searching, data analysis, and data presentation. The laboratory essay examines and researches an environmental physiology topic introduced in the laboratory periods." ;

Fisheries and their impacts are also a major driving force in the global economy, with seafood now being the most widely traded food commodity in the world. Fisheries also have substantial social implications, ranging from increasing poverty and human migrations in West Africa to the emergence of modern piracy in Somalia and elsewhere. This unit will provide students with a solid grounding in the foundations of fisheries science, and identify features, methods and principles of fisheries science used to inform policy and management of both large and small-scale fisheries around the world. In addition to the scientific foundations and principles around fisheries science, this unit will also provide and discuss a range of applied examples from both global and local West Australian fisheries. Core elements will include the foundation principles of fisheries science, the core data needs in fisheries science, introduction to methods used in assessing fish populations, and their application to fisheries data sets at different scales.

    rel:Description """Environmental Engineering problems are complex and challenging, with modelling approaches typically playing a central role in evaluation of solutions. Modelling complex environmental systems is thus a core skill of professional Environmental Engineers. This modelling may be analytical, physical, numerical or empirical in nature. This unit introduces students to the modelling process in Environmental Engineering. Models will be developed to understand how a wide range of environmental systems (atmospheric, marine/coastal, hydrological and urban water systems) function and respond to perturbation. 
Students work through the modelling process in Environmental Engineering including: model conceptualization; choosing between modelling approaches of various complexities; model construction, including in a numerical programming environment; model calibration and validation; assessment of model uncertainty and sensitivity; critical evaluation of model output; and communication of modelling results to an engineering audience.
This unit will utilise problem-based learning, meaning students will learn about model conceptualization and construction in the context of relevant Environmental Engineering challenges, with real datasets to validate the models developed. It is expected that students will develop their programming skills in this unit in using a numerical programming language for model construction.""" ;

Students read key texts by protofeminist or feminist writers from a range of disciplines, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Mary Daly, Audre Lorde, the French feminists, Alice Walker, Donna Haraway, and Gloria Anzaldua. Through this interdisciplinary survey, students critically evaluate the multiple strands of feminist thought, including liberal, radical, socialist, psychoanalytic, ecological, postcolonial, postmodern and post-feminist. Students undertake 'slow readings' of the key texts, with certain activities and assessments foregrounding affective or 'feelingful' responses which are explored prior to critical and analytical exploration of the texts. This work of 'slow reading' is linked to a methodological focus on (1) the role of affect in knowledge production; and (2) the importance of listening in fostering transformative cultural change. As a Category A Broadening unit and also a level 3 core unit for students undertaking the gender studies major, the unit also provides an opportunity for students with differing levels of knowledge about feminism to engage in respectful and constructive discussion of the issues, in a way that mirrors the dynamics of many feminist interventions in the world beyond university." ;

Over history, our brains have contribute to complex and mysterious behaviours in many different cultures and societies. The human brain is the most complex organ of the body and arguably the most complex thing on earth! 
In this unit, students become explorers of the human brain and the behaviours that it underpins. Each week, the unit describes the most up to date information about how the brain is involved in a particular aspect of human behaviour. It then extends and challenges students' thinking to consider the significance and impact of this behaviour on ourselves and on society. It helps students to seek a new way to approach some of the really challenging and important questions in life such as—What is beauty? Why do we have wars? How does the brain process mystical and religious experiences? Why do we love music? Why are jokes funny?

A further and important academic objective is to address the discipline's evolution and place in academia as part of the discussion of how Asia is given meaning as a field of academic study. Students are equipped to describe and evaluate the various meanings and representations of Asia and critique the way in which Asia as an 'entity' and idea has been 'constructed' both internally and externally.

In particular, the unit complements the Japanese language units on offer by reinforcing students' appreciation of the sociocultural context within which the language operates. Using a multidisciplinary approach and with reference to both academic and popular culture texts and resources, the unit draws attention to the complex interplay between discourses, institutions and practices of work, family, culture, nation/citizenship and gender and sexuality in the day-to-day dynamics of Japanese society. These issues are examined both with reference to domestic Japanese society and in relation to the broader Asia–Pacific context. 
The first half of the unit provides a framework for understanding Japan's sociocultural and economic transformations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, both with reference to domestic society and in relation to the wider Asia–Pacific region. The second half of the unit focuses on specific 'case studies' and discussion topics including: (1) Japan in relation to research debates on sociocultural change; (2) changing discourses of identity and nation; (3) popular culture and urban consumer culture; (4) shifting discourses of gender and sexuality; and (5) changing attitudes to work and corporate culture.""" ;

Is it about unions, about strikes, about negotiation of wages and conditions, about freedom of contract? What happens when a manager wants to introduce some changes or a worker is concerned about safety issues? Why are employment relations good in some companies but not in others? How do systems of employment relations respond to external disruptions? By examining employment relations, work and society, this unit lays the foundations for the study of employment relations and so helps the student to answer questions such as these. The unit discusses the nature of work and the relationship between employer and employee, and considers the role of key actors, that is management, the state and trade unions.

The evolution of animals will be illustrated using the classic study of the change in body structure (‘bauplans'), from simple to complex tissues, organs, segmentation, limbs and other body parts.  This will be compared with evolution discerned by modern molecular sequence methods, and how the differences between these methods can be understood.  Factors influencing the evolution of animal diversity will be explored, within and between phyla, in the context of coincidental changes in climate, geology, and ecology throughout evolutionary history.

Firstly, there remain entrenched gender imbalances in many STEM (science,technology, engineering and maths) fields. Secondly, ideas about 'hard-wired' sex differences of body and/or brain, as well as ideas about gender fluidity, circulate freely in popular culture. Thirdly, theories of gender and scientific discourses are sometimes at odds. In all three scenarios, 'gender' and 'science' are held in some kind of relation. This unit is a collaboration between humanities and STEM academics at UWA, which explores how theories of gender 'explain' science; how science 'explains' gender; and how the discourses of gender studies and science can productively intersect. It is a core unit for students in the major of Gender Studies, as well as students majoring in Science and Technology Studies; but experienced students from any major — and especially STEM majors — are also welcome." ;

Yet, when poorly planned and managed, urbanization generates inequalities and has already left a billion people living in slums with inadequate and often precarious living conditions. Urbanisation and the political, cultural and economic structures that sustain urban life are key drivers of global environmental change. If steered and deployed correctly, however, urbanisation can help the world overcome some of its major global challenges including poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, climate change, fragility and conflict.

Statistical methods are discussed to better understand noise processes and how signal noise can be minimised. Methods to improve signal quality (signal to noise ratio) are discussed. Measurement signal and noise are analysed in both the time and frequency domain to better understand the connection between two domains and the importance of measurement bandwidth. Sampling is reviewed to understand the impact of moving from continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT), including discussion of the Nyquist rate and aliasing.

    rel:Description """This unit introduces students to the main physiological systems in the human body. There is an emphasis on the physiological mechanisms utilised by the cells, tissues and organs of these systems to maintain the internal environment and allow the human body to function.
The unit starts with an examination of how the brain coordinates the overall activity of body tissues, organs and systems, using specialised nerve and hormonal signalling pathways. Students are then provided with an in-depth look at how the cardiovascular system (heart and the circulation) works to provide the tissues with nutrients and oxygen as well as the removal waste material. This is followed by an examination of how the respiratory system (lungs and associated tissues), functions to ensure adequate uptake of oxygen and removal of  carbon dioxide by the body. Students will then be introduced to the renal system (kidneys and associated tissues) and shown how this system regulates the fluid and salt composition of the body and helps rid the body of waste materials and toxins such as pesticides.  The reproductive system will also be covered, with a focus on the hormonal control mechanisms governing spermatogenesis (sperm production) and the ovarian cycle (preparation of the ova). Finally, students will examine the gastrointestinal system (stomach, intestines and associate structures) and learn how this system undertakes the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
In addition to examining the normal functions of the human body, this unit also provides many  examples outlining how disease can severely disrupt the function of the physiological systems described above. 
Four practical classes are provided in this unit. These classes are designed to reinforce the theoretical content presented in the physiological control, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal system components of the course. The practical component will also  provide students with important insights into experimental design, as well and experience and skills in making clinically relevant physiological measurements such as blood pressure (heart disease), the electrocardiograph (ECG) (heart disease), the ability of the lungs to inhale and forcibly exhale air (asthma), and urine volume, sodium concentration, and specific gravity, which provide information about bodily salt and water balance.""" ;

This results in greater political instability and social unrest, and among other things, impedes the poorest in society in building resilience and adaptive capacity in the face of global crises such as pandemics and the far-reaching impacts of global environmental change. It also presents challenges to our ability to advance just and equitable long-term national and regional developmental trajectories and design effective policy responses to global crises. But how did the world come to be in this state? 
	This unit equips students with a conceptual toolkit of critical reasoning and analytical skills with which to understand the spatially uneven nature of development across time, and at a range of scales. It takes a geographical approach to examining the relationship between historical, economic, demographic, political and environmental processes, and the social and spatial structures through which inequalities are produced and sustained. Viewed from the perspective of interdependent national and regional economies and processes of population change (fertility, mortality and migration), the unit focusses on restructuring spatial divisions of labour, access to and exploitation of natural resources, global systems of trade, and entrenched drivers of poverty, to consider how the lives of the wealthy and poor are entwined through both local and globally interdependent systems, and the implications of these systems for the world's ecosystems.""" ;

In organisations, commercial and non-commercial, large and small, marketing is the function that links the organisation to the external environment. First, marketing is responsible for gathering and analysing data from many sources, such as social media. Then, based on this market research, marketing is responsible for developing products and services for many different customers, and then promoting these offerings in many ways, such as search engines.
All organisations carry out marketing. You even have to market yourself! In this unit, students are introduced to a range of marketing topics, hopefully creating an interest to learn more in the specific marketing major units in following years.""" ;

    rel:Description "Plants have literally shaped the Earth and its environment, priming the great oxygenation event several billion years ago which enabled the evolution of all aerobic life. We are sustained by the bountiful plant life around us, but it is their capacity to adapt and acclimate to wide conditions that make studying plants so interesting. This plasticity driven by the plant genome underpins native ecosystems, enables restoration of toxic or nutrient-poor land, as well as the use of plants in managed systems including agriculture. Plants also have a wide range of relationships with other organisms, from food or host to symbiont or parasite. Grain/seed production sustains the energy requirements of the growing human population, as well as being one of the major international commodities traded around the world. Plant metabolic pathways facilitate acclimation to a changing environment and produce compounds (e.g. vitamins) essential for human and animal health. This unit takes students through the parts (organs, tissues and cells) that make up plants, and considers the relationships and influences of plants on the environment and other organisms. Students will gain practical skills in evaluating plant function in the context of many disciplines. Topics include the structure–physiology relationships at the cell, tissue, organ, plant and community levels; plant growth and development; transfer processes in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum; energy capture and metabolism; water relations; nutrient acquisition; and acclimations to the environment." ;

The first half of the unit covers several influential theories about what makes an action or policy morally right or morally wrong: the divine command theory, moral relativism, utilitarianism, two aspects of Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory, and virtue ethics. In the second half of the unit, applied ethical questions concerning cutting-edge digital technologies are discussed. In the near future, for example, autonomous vehicles will be routinely confronted with the need to make life-or-death decisions. What values should we ‘programme in' to such machines, and how should we decide? Is it possible for a machine to reason morally? How should we manage the risks inherent in the development of new technology? Is there a legitimate role for artificial intelligence in the law? Might sufficiently developed forms of artificial intelligence be said to have a form of consciousness, and might this have implications for how they ought to be treated?" ;

Cells are complex systems containing many thousands of small molecules and larger macromolecules. This complexity enables cells to divide, grow and respond to external changes, and allows specialised cells of multicellular organisms to perform their particular functions. In this unit, the focus is on how these cellular functions are controlled and regulated by intracellular signals and extracellular signals. Understanding how cells regulate their activities allows insight into how an organism responds to and copes with its environment, nutrients and/or diet, infection and disease. The content of the unit is divided into five major themes: (1) metabolic pathways; (2) organelles and energy production; (3) post-translational signal transduction pathways; (4) transcriptional signal transduction pathways; and (5) the cell cycle—regulation and cancer.

There is a range of learning activities in this unit, including lectures, problem-based tutorials, laboratory activities, the fluid mechanics photography competition, and optional ‘master classes' on everyday fluid phenomena (such as the fluid dynamics of sport, kitchen fluid mechanics, the automatic shut-off of a petrol pump and scaling relationships in the natural world). Topics covered include:
(1)	Equations of fluid motion applied to a control volume: Principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy applied to a fluid volume, key fluid properties including viscosity, surface tension and specific gravity.
(2)	Dimensional analysis and similitude: Using the Buckingham-pi theorem to determine the dimensionless parameters that govern fluid systems, using dimensional analysis to get order of magnitude solutions to complex problems, designing models of fluid systems.
(3)	Pipe flow: Evaluating the dissipation of mechanical energy in pipe flow due to friction and turbulence, predicting flow velocities, flowrates and pressures in pipes, use of pump curves to predict flowrates in pump-pipe systems;
(4)	Open-channel flow: Manning's equation for predicting the depth of uniform open-channel flow, using specific energy curves to predict changes in depth in rapidly-varied flows, quantifying the depth increase and energy dissipation across hydraulic jumps;
(5)	Equations of fluid motion in differential form: Principles of conservation of mass and momentum in differential form, solving the Navier-Stokes equations to determine profiles of velocity, shear stress and pressure in planar flows;

This section includes a consideration of the chemo–electrical interactions that occur between cells in early stages of sensory pathways; and (4) Generation of mechanical force by cells, relating molecular processes to functional contraction of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles.

    rel:Description "This unit examines how visual representations have been constructed, circulated and seen throughout history. Exploring themes such as beauty and ugliness, identity, and the economics of art, the unit investigates the meaning of images and objects across time and cultures. Each week offers a different methodological approach to analysing art, allowing students to explore how lenses such as gender, race or politics shape our understanding of visual forms. By experimenting with different ways of seeing, students gain insight into how the value of art and visual representation has evolved over time. How we see affects what we see and the unit enhances visual literacy while honing each student's critical eye. Emphasising oral and written communication as well as refining research skills, the unit has broad applications to a variety of different disciplines and encourages students to become critical viewers of our increasingly visual world." ;

It covers basic principles in ecology including community and population structure and dynamics; biogeography; productivity and trophic relationships; and nutrient and water cycling processes. The unit also develops an evolutionary and biogeographical framework to understand biodiversity and rarity of plants and animals in terrestrial and marine environments. It emphasises timescales and spatial scales and their importance to processes of evolution and environmental change in Australia. Human impacts on species and ecosystems are a recurring theme. Guest lecturers who are practising ecologists provide specialist knowledge, case studies and hot topics in ecology. Ecological methods, taught during laboratory sessions and a field trip, focus on ecological sampling techniques and experimental approaches to ecology. There is an emphasis on the scientific method, in particular the development and testing of hypotheses, and scientific reporting, both in writing and verbally." ;

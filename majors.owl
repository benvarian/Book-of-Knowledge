It strives to discover how the Earth system has evolved during the past 4.4 billion years including the origin of continents, oceans, atmosphere and life itself. Geology students learn how to apply knowledge of Earth processes, and the time scales over which these processes operate, to discovering the origin and distribution of important resources such as groundwater, petroleum and minerals, and understanding climate and other environmental changes. As most of Australia's mineral and petroleum resources are in Western Australia, UWA is the ideal place to study Geology. The Geology major is underpinned by the development of fieldwork skills and geological mapping and includes three 7-day field trips to areas in Western Australia (there will be a cost of up to \$1200 per student, to cover the cost of food and accommodation for ~21 nights).">

  <has_description rdf:resource="#Anthropology is the comparative study of human diversity, past and present. It examines behaviour, relationships and meaning within and between different societies and cultures. This major incorporates the study of key anthropological theories, and the history of the discipline, and introduces students to anthropological perspectives on: religion and ritual, politics, kinship and land rights, and ecology and environment. It does so in a way that elucidates local experiences, yet addresses the ‘big questions' for the future of human societies: not least that of climate change. The major provides students with a comprehensive overview of one of the social sciences' core research methods: ethnography. Throughout, an emphasis is placed upon active learning and assessment, which enable students to develop job-ready skills, for working in fields such as: heritage, community and social development, or policy and analysis – in Australia, or anywhere in the world."/>

  <has_description rdf:resource="#Classics and Ancient History is the study of the languages, literature, history, art and archaeology of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations. These two cultures lie at the very foundation of the modern world, and we are surrounded by their legacy: from the Olympic Games to the alphabet, from democracy to Christianity, from theatre to the rule of law—wherever we turn we find ourselves in their debt. These uncannily familiar Greeks and the Romans struggled with many of the same crucial issues as we do: globalisation, the 'clash of civilisations' and the decline of great powers. This exciting major lets you combine the languages with the history and archaeology of the classical world to give you a holistic picture of this vibrant and eternally relevant era. UWA is the only university in Western Australia where you can study this intriguing major."/>

  <has_description rdf:resource="#The Indonesian Studies major enables students to achieve a high level of fluency in the language of Australia's closest neighbour and the world's fourth largest country. Indonesian is a relatively easy language to learn as it uses the Roman script and is simple to spell and pronounce. As well as learning how to speak, read and write Indonesian, students study Indonesia's vibrant culture, ethnically diverse society and never dull politics. There are also short and semester-long opportunities for students to spend time studying at an Indonesian university, a life-changing experience. Students graduate with a portfolio of skills and attributes that are much in demand by employers in both the public and private sectors. "/>

The Italian Studies major teaches you high levels of competency in speaking, writing, listening and reading. It also offers a wide perspective on Italian culture, considering not only the culture and history of Italy itself but also Italian-speaking communities around the world including Australia.

Do the sciences tell us the truth about the world? How can we say what we mean? Are other people's experiences like our own? What does it mean to be conscious? What are emotions and how are they relevant to our lives? Philosophy teaches you to distinguish between good and bad arguments and make informed recommendations on contentious issues. Studying Philosophy allows you to explore a vast range of influential ideas, from the ancient philosophers, whose works are preserved in manuscripts from India, China and Greece, right down to cutting-edge contemporary work on pressing ethical issues, the nature of mind and artificial intelligence.

  <has_description rdf:resource="#The study of Philosophy involves thinking about some of the big questions we ask during our lifetime: Does God exist? Do the sciences tell us the truth about the world? How can we say what we mean? Are other people's experiences like our own? What does it mean to be conscious? What are emotions and how are they relevant to our lives? Philosophy teaches you to distinguish between good and bad arguments and make informed recommendations on contentious issues. Studying Philosophy allows you to explore a vast range of influential ideas, from the ancient philosophers, whose works are preserved in manuscripts from India, China and Greece, right down to cutting-edge contemporary work on pressing ethical issues, the nature of mind and artificial intelligence. UWA is the only university in Western Australia that teaches units in formal logic."/>

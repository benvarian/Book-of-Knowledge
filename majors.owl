Mechanical Engineering at UWA has been designed to produce graduates who have a solid foundation in the science and mathematics that underpin the discipline, a detailed understanding of the core subject areas within the discipline, and the skills to apply that knowledge in varied and changing environments.  You will have the skills to learn and apply new specialised knowledge in emerging fields involving new technologies."/>

Botanists study how plants evolve and adapt to changing climates and environments and have a proactive role in mitigating the loss of biodiversity. Botany is an ideal major if you are enthusiastic about Western Australia's unique native flora or agricultural crops, and are interested in addressing current and future threats to plant conservation and sustainability. It is envisaged that there will be up to three overnight field trips (there will be a cost of up to \$500 to cover food and accommodation for around 10 nights, to be borne by the student)."/>

  <has_description rdf:resource="#Geology is an applied science that aims to understand all aspects of our planet, from Earth's surface to the deep interior. It strives to discover how the Earth system has evolved during the past 4.4 billion years including the origin of continents, oceans, atmosphere and life itself. Geology students learn how to apply knowledge of Earth processes, and the time scales over which these processes operate, to discovering the origin and distribution of important resources such as groundwater, petroleum and minerals, and understanding climate and other environmental changes. As most of Australia's mineral and petroleum resources are in Western Australia, UWA is the ideal place to study Geology. The Geology major is underpinned by the development of fieldwork skills and geological mapping and includes three 7-day field trips to areas in Western Australia (there will be a cost of up to \$1200 per student, to cover the cost of food and accommodation for ~21 nights)."/>

  <has_description rdf:resource="#Western Australia's marine estate is unique globally. It features a vast array of marine and coastal environments, oceanographic conditions, and is a biodiversity hotspot with up to 80 per cent of its fish, invertebrates and other organisms found nowhere else in the world. This makes WA an ideal living laboratory for your marine studies. This extended major will expose you to the full breadth of the marine science discipline, allowing a deeper understanding of both the physical and biological components through the marine biology and marine and coastal processes majors. It combines knowledge of marine life with a solid understanding of the physical process across all coastal marine environments. Through experimental design and research, both in the field and in laboratories, you will learn to appreciate the complex interactions that occur between marine ecosystems and physical processes. During your studies, you will gain practical experience through field trips (several of which are overnight) and computer-based labs. This extended major is the ultimate multi- and interdisciplinary learning environment that will best place you to continue your studies as a postgraduate student or pursue a career in a marine-related discipline after graduation."/>

This major is designed to provide students with a general understanding of archaeology globally and and more specific understanding of Australian archaeology over the last 65,000 years. Topics include: human origins and symbolic behaviour, stone tools, rock art, archaeozoology, archaeobotany, forensics, scientific dating, Indigenous knowledge, historical and maritime archaeology. We also examine and put into practice how archaeology contributes to contemporary issues like heritage management, graffiti and homelessness. The analytical and practical elements of the discipline - in which valuable transferable and experiential work-integrated skills are learned - are taught within laboratory and field work units. Three annual field schools are held dealing with archaeology, rock art and forensic science respectively. UWA Archaeology's teaching is research-led by some of the leading scholars in the field.

Chinese Studies equips students with solid language skills and a broad in-depth knowledge of China, its society and people, placing students in a strong position to utilise the opportunities generated by China's long history, rich culture and rapid economic growth. Students will graduate with an in-depth understanding of the increasingly globalising world, as well as a versatile portfolio of skills and aptitudes which enhance employability."/>

  <has_description rdf:resource="#Italian Studies involves the study of the Italian language as well as its culture. As a language, Italian is rewarding to study—opening up the riches of Italy's cultural past and the fascination of its dynamic present. It is the most widely spoken language in Australia after English because of the ongoing migrant, intellectual, cultural and commercial links between Australia and Italy. The Italian Studies major teaches you high levels of competency in speaking, writing, listening and reading. It also offers a wide perspective on Italian culture, considering not only the culture and history of Italy itself but also Italian-speaking communities around the world including Australia. We offer this major at all levels to challenge and engage you throughout your studies—from beginners through to native speakers. You will also be encouraged to enhance your educational experience by participating in exchange programs in Italy at approved universities such as Siena, Milan or Perugia."/>

Do the sciences tell us the truth about the world? How can we say what we mean? Are other people's experiences like our own? What does it mean to be conscious? What are emotions and how are they relevant to our lives? Philosophy teaches you to distinguish between good and bad arguments and make informed recommendations on contentious issues. Studying Philosophy allows you to explore a vast range of influential ideas, from the ancient philosophers, whose works are preserved in manuscripts from India, China and Greece, right down to cutting-edge contemporary work on pressing ethical issues, the nature of mind and artificial intelligence.

  <has_description rdf:resource="#The study of Philosophy involves thinking about some of the big questions we ask during our lifetime: Does God exist? Do the sciences tell us the truth about the world? How can we say what we mean? Are other people's experiences like our own? What does it mean to be conscious? What are emotions and how are they relevant to our lives? Philosophy teaches you to distinguish between good and bad arguments and make informed recommendations on contentious issues. Studying Philosophy allows you to explore a vast range of influential ideas, from the ancient philosophers, whose works are preserved in manuscripts from India, China and Greece, right down to cutting-edge contemporary work on pressing ethical issues, the nature of mind and artificial intelligence. UWA is the only university in Western Australia that teaches units in formal logic."/>
